The problem is from leet code.
And the process is as follows 
     we need to find whether the matrix taken from user is satisfying the given conditions.
      1) the matrix can be of any size.
      2) the sum of first row and sum of the last row should be equal
      3) same continues for the remaining rows 
      4) if there are n rows then 1st and nth row sum should be equal and 2nd and n-1th row sum should be equal and the same follows for 
          remaining rows.
solution:
    there are two conditions if the no of rows are even and no of rows are odd.
    case 1:  the number of rows are even then we just have to run the loop for n/2 times and solve the problem
    case 2:  the number of rows are odd then also we run the code for n/2 times but we ignore the middle row in the matrix.
    finally if all the sums of the corresponding rows are equal then print true else false.
